You can have a practical like  
Secure ETL & Data Engineering to Build a controlled data ingestion and preprocessing pipeline.  
  
Data-Simulated datasets  
sensor_logs.csv  
mission_profile.json  
maintenance_records.csv  
  
✔ Ingest multi-source data  
✔ Merge using Equipment ID & Timestamp  
✔ Handle missing sensor data  
Feature engineering:  
rolling averages  
risk indicators  
categorical encoding  
  
Store processed data into:  
secure local data lake folder  
SQLite / PostgreSQL  

For 5th march  
You can teach GPU scheduling and multi-agent orchestration concepts without actual GPUs by using simulation + CPU-based execution +   logical resource modeling.  

Participants design and simulate a defense AI system architecture using multi-agent components and orchestrated pipelines on CPU-only systems. They model resource constraints logically and implement priority-based scheduling for real-time and batch tasks. The exercise focuses on agent coordination, pipeline orchestration, and fault-tolerant system design for on-prem deployments. Final output is a complete system architecture and workflow diagram reflecting mission-critical AI operations.
